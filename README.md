# Library
I've been looking for a long time for an organized and simple way to save articles/links/guides/etc. In the past, I've used in-browser bookmarks, apps like Evernote and Trello, and RSS readers to keep everything organized. I've never been completely happy with any of those solutions. But now, I'm using this repository to do just that - organize.

And it's all thanks to @helenvholmes. You can check out her [library](https://github.com/helenvholmes/library) which served as the inspiration for all of this.

*Feel free to use the idea for yourself or fork this repo.*
